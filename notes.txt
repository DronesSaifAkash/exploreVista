-------------------------
Your flow for the tour and travels website is well-organized, covering both user and admin functionalities comprehensively. Here's a quick breakdown of how you could implement this in your React project:

User/Visitor Side:
1. District-wise Tour Packages:
   - Fetch and display tour packages based on the selected district. // done
   - Create a route like `/districts/:districtCode/tour-packages` to load district-related packages.
   
2. Destination-wise Tour Packages:
   - Similar to districts, fetch and display packages for specific destinations.
   - Route example: `/destinations/:destinationCode/tour-packages`.

3. Destination Details Page:
   - Include key details about the destination. 
   - Add a "Select Tour Package" option with links to available packages.

4. District Details Page:
   - Display all spots within the district. // done 
   - Let users filter or select packages based on the spots.
   
5. Tour Packages by Group Size:
   - Provide options to filter packages by members (single, couple, family/group).
   - You can implement this as a filter dropdown or toggle buttons.

6. Portal Features:
   - Contact Us: Create a form for users to submit inquiries. // done 
   - Top Feedbacks: Display user feedback on the homepage or a dedicated section.
   - User Registration and Login: Handle this with JWT-based authentication, ensuring access to user-specific content once logged in.

User Dashboard:
1. Booking Details: Show a list of past and current bookings.
2. Contact Us and Previous Communications: Allow users to view past inquiries and responses.
3. Feedback Submission: Let users send feedback through the dashboard.
4. Profile Management: Include options for updating profile details and passwords.

Admin Dashboard:
1. Destination Management: Add and manage destinations based on districts. // done 
2. Tour Package Management: Admin can create, edit, and delete tour packages.
3. Contact Us Details: View submitted inquiries and respond to them.
4. Feedback Approval: Admin can approve or reject user feedback for public display.
5. User Management: Activate or deactivate users as needed.

With these features in mind, structuring your React components and backend APIs will ensure smooth integration. Let me know if you'd like more detailed guidance on any specific feature!
